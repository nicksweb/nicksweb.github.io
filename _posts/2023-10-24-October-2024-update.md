# The Happenings on the SANetwork Homelab

Over the past few years, I've reached a point where my homelab operates almost autonomously. Most of the equipment is connected to a UPS to ensure safe shutdowns during power outages. Furthermore, I've established a weekly backup schedule that covers all core VMs. I also employ a Helpdesk system ([OSTicket](https://osticket.com/)) to capture alerts from various services, which also serves as a sort of to-do list.

Currently, I've been testing a mail server built with Docker - [MAILU](https://mailu.io/).
