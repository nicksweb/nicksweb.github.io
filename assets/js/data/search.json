Most of the equipment is connected to a UPS to ensure safe shutdowns during power outages. Furthermore, I’ve established a weekly backup schedule that covers all core VMs. I also employ a Helpdesk system (OSTicket) to capture alerts from various services, which also serves as a sort of to-do list.Currently, I’ve been testing a mail server built with Docker - MAILU." }, { "title": "NickOsullivan.id.au/Blog has moved", "url": "/posts/blog-content-has-moved/", "categories": "General", "tags": "general", "date": "2022-08-07 15:30:00 +1000", "snippet": "NickOsullivan.id.au/blog has moved to the new and exciting URL of blog.nickosullivan.id.au.This move was required to streamline the development cycle of the nickosullivan.id.au site which is now running on Jekyll." }, { "title": "Automating my Home Lab", "url": "/posts/automating-my-homelab/", "categories": "Linux, Ansible, Shell", "tags": "homelab, ansible, github", "date": "2022-08-07 06:00:00 +1000", "snippet": "The last month I’ve been focusing on documenting as much as I can aboot my HomeLab environment.After having ran a homelab for about 5 years and gaining confidence in the command line of Linux - At some stage it just becomes second nature to quickly spin-up a docker, virtual server or raspberry pi with a software package you’re wanting to test out. Well, that’s the stage I’m at now.Sure, I use the Homer Dashboard to keep track of the services on the network - But, there’s still a lot of services that I might use a handful of times across the course of a month.Part of what I’ve been working on the last few months is documenting my server setup with Ansible and Shell Scripts. I’m completing this in the hope that should I have a server or service failure - I can easily with minimal delays spin-up a new instance from a backup if necessary.To the most part, most of my server instances are well backed up and documented - But, when it come to my main Desktop PC - That’s another story - It’s my all for my Linux Environment - It hosts my most important SSH Keys, Ansible and Jekly environments.Though, it is backed up - There’s that many customizations to areas such as fstab and other utilities that I’m a bit hesitant to blow away my machine and upgrade from 20.04LTS to 22.04LTS.Anyway, I’m slowing getting to the point - I just need to do it - But, I think I might have to leave it for another weekend!" }, { "title": "Welcome to the new Site", "url": "/posts/welcome-to-the-new-site/", "categories": "General", "tags": "general", "date": "2022-07-30 06:00:00 +1000", "snippet": "Recently, I’ve been venturing into the realm of Ruby with Jekyll - A static site generator.So far, it’s taken me a month to go live with this template - But, I think I’m ready for production - So, welcome to the new site!" } ]
